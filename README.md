QR Code
==============

This is my first Elgg plugin.
This plugin displays QR Code on Elgg pages. 

- Currently works with Elgg 1.8

features:

* adds a QR Code Image(URL of the page) with QR parameters customizable through Admin interface.(Size, ECC Level)
The QR Image is displayed on the sidebar of most pages except Admin, members etc

install:

1. deactivate and remove any previous version of the plugin from the mod folder
2. extract the zip file for this plugin and move the extracted files into the mod folder
3. activate the plugin.
4. optional: choose various options in admin panel for customizing the QR Code displayed

ToDo:

* Apply QR to other special sections like bookmarks

Notes:

* Size options need to to be reconsidered
* Check our repository [https://github.com/lonerider79/qrcode.git]

Credits:

* http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/ library folks whose code forms the base of the plugin.
* Matt Beckett of elgg Beginners forum for his help at various stages during the development.
